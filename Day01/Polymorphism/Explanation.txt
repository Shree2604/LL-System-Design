Beginner Explanation

Compile-time polymorphism (Overloading):
Method assignOrder is written in two versions (one with partner name only, one with partner name + vehicle).
Java decides which one to call when you compile the program.

Runtime polymorphism (Overriding):
Parent class: DeliveryPartner has a method deliver.
Child classes (BikePartner, CarPartner) override it.
Which version gets executed depends on the object at runtime.
