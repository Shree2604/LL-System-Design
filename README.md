# Low-Level System Design

## 📚 Overview
This repository is a comprehensive collection of Low-Level System Design patterns, case studies, and best practices. It's designed to help you prepare for system design interviews and build robust, scalable systems in real-world scenarios.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Understand fundamental system design concepts and patterns
- Learn through practical case studies of popular systems
- Prepare for system design interviews with real-world examples
- Implement best practices for building scalable and maintainable systems
